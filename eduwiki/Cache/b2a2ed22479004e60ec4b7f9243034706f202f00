Vis a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics that holds that a physical system\u2014such as an electron\u2014exists partly in all its particular theoretically possible states ( or , configuration of its properties ) simultaneously ; but when measured or observed , it gives a result corresponding to only one of the possible configurations ( as described in interpretation of quantum mechanics ) .
