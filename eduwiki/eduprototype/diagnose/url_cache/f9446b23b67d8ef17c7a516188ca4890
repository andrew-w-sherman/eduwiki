Frameless construction in cabinetmaking refers to the construction of cabinets using flat panels of engineered wood  usually particle board, plywood or medium-density fibreboard  rather than the traditional frame and panel construction.
A common construction method for frameless cabinets originated in Europe after World War II and is known as the 32 mm Method or 32 mm System. This nomenclature is derived from the 32 mm spacing between the system holes used for construction and installation of hardware typically used for doors, drawers and shelves. In North America it is also often referred to as "European Cabinetry" popular due to its simplicity of construction, clean lines and low cost.
With frameless cabinets, thicker sides (boxes) keep the cabinet much more stable and avoids the use of a front frame. By eliminating the front frame, you can have more room to get large objects inside with more usable space.
