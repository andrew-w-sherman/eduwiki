Guido van Rossum (born 31 January 1956) is a Dutch computer programmer who is best known as the author of the Python programming language. In the Python community, Van Rossum is known as a "Benevolent Dictator For Life" (BDFL), meaning that he continues to oversee the Python development process, making decisions where necessary. He was employed by Google from 2005 until December 7th 2012, where he spent half his time developing the Python language. In January 2013, Van Rossum started working for Dropbox.


== Biography ==
Van Rossum was born and grew up in the Netherlands, where he received a masters degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Amsterdam in 1982. He later worked for various research institutes, including the Dutch Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), Amsterdam, the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, Maryland, and the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI), Reston, Virginia.


== Personal life ==
Guido van Rossum is the brother of Just van Rossum, a type designer and programmer. Just van Rossum designed the typeface that is used in the "Python Powered" logo. Guido lives in Belmont, California with his wife, Kim Knapp, and their son, Orlijn.


== Work ==
While working at the Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI), Guido van Rossum wrote and contributed a glob() routine to BSD Unix in 1986. Van Rossum also worked on the development of the ABC programming language.


=== Python ===

About the origin of Python, Van Rossum wrote in 1996:

Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).

In 2000 he further wrote:

Python's predecessor, ABC, was inspired by SETL  Lambert Meertens spent a year with the SETL group at NYU before coming up with the final ABC design!


=== Computer Programming for Everybody ===
In 1999, Van Rossum submitted a funding proposal to DARPA called Computer Programming for Everybody, in which he further defined his goals for Python:
an easy and intuitive language just as powerful as major competitors
open source, so anyone can contribute to its development
code that is as understandable as plain English
suitability for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times
Python has grown to become a popular programming language: For example, as of November 2011, it is the 3rd most popular language on the GitHub social coding website, and according to a programming language popularity survey it is consistently amongst the top 10 most mentioned languages in job postings. Additionally, it is consistently in the top 10 most popular languages according to the TIOBE Programming Community Index.


=== Mondrian (Google software) ===

Working for Google, Van Rossum developed Mondrian, a code review system internally used by the Google company. The code is web-based and primarily based on Python.
Van Rossum named the software after Piet Mondrian (18721944; birth name Mondriaan), a Dutch painter. He named another, related software project after Gerrit Rietveld, another Dutch designer.


=== Dropbox ===
On Dec 7, 2012, Dropbox announced that Van Rossum would be joining the company.


=== Recognition ===
Van Rossum received the 2001 Award for the Advancement of Free Software from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) at the 2002 FOSDEM conference in Brussels, Belgium.
Van Rossum received a NLUUG Award in May 2003.
In 2006, Van Rossum was recognized as a Distinguished Engineer by the Association for Computing Machinery.
