                <p>
                    In <em>machine learning</em>, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks[1]) are <em>supervised learning</em> models with associated <em>learning algorithms</em> that analyze data and recognize patterns, used for <em>classification</em> and <em>regression analysis</em>. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples into one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary <em>linear classifier</em>. An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall on.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the <em>kernel trick</em>, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.
