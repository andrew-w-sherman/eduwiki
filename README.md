# EduWiki
This repo contains prototypes of the EduWiki and Parliament systems. These were experimental systems that were designed to create crowd-generated lessons for arbitrary topics. They evolved into the as-of-yet-unnamed project [here](https://github.com/andrew-w-sherman/turk-study) which focuses on curating links as a method of crowd-generating lessons.
