VFor the journal with this title, see Historical Social Research.\u000a\u000aIn physics and computer science, quantum information is physical information that is held in the state of a quantum system. Quantum information is the basic entity that is studied in the burgeoning field of quantum information theory, and manipulated using the engineering techniques of quantum information processing. Much like classical information can be processed with digital computers, transmitted from place to place, manipulated with algorithms, and analyzed with the mathematics of computer science, so also analogous concepts apply to quantum information.
